    <h5 class="upper">4.1	Step A.1. Initiating and launching the NAP process</h5>

    <p><b>Overview:</b> Step 1 consists of the initiation of the NAP process at the national level through an appropriate mandate and the mobilization of relevant institutional arrangements and support. In countries where work relevant to the NAP process is already under way and appropriate mandates exist, this step would enhance those efforts and proceed to producing a road map for steps that would still need to be undertaken. The mandate will help to establish a clear vision for the NAP process including expectations and outputs. It will also help to create leadership and en-sure stakeholder participation. Many of the subsequent steps depend on a country’s vision of its NAP process.</p>

    <h6 class="upper">A.1.a	Conduct briefings to policymakers about climate change adaptation challenges and opportunities, and the NAP process in particular</h6>
    <p>In order for policymakers to make informed decisions on the NAP process and its design over the medium- and long-term, and in order for the public to support a major national approach, it would be useful for the country’s UNFCCC climate change focal point to undertake a targeted awareness campaign. This campaign

    could, for example, consist of briefings to policymakers, which could receive sup-port from relevant organizations where needed. Such briefings could include a de-scription of the experienced and expected economic and social impacts of climate change and the actions required to adapt, highlighting opportunities that the NAP process would present to the country. The campaign should introduce and describe the NAP process, based on the COP decisions and the NAP guidelines, to ensure all stakeholders have the same understanding of its benefits, such as its process-based approach.</p>

    <p>A good understanding of the NAP process is key to a successful launch of activities.</p>

    <h6 class="upper">A.1.b	Designate the spearheading or coordinating mechanism</h6>

    <p>In order to operationalize an effective NAP process, it will be necessary for govern-ments to designate the government agency (or agencies) or institutions responsible for spearheading the process. This will entail mobilizing dedicated human resourc-es and ensuring that the designated coordinating mechanism has the tools and means to reach the NAP governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. Much as with NAPAs, a multidisciplinary team of lead experts with functioning networks in each sector would be useful. Appropriate levels of authority, a hosting arrange-ment, accountabilities, access to information and data sharing protocols as well as adequate financial, human and logistical resources would be key considerations for the operations of this coordinating mechanism. These considerations could be included in the funding proposal submitted to the GEF and other funding agencies for the NAP process (see section A.1.D).</p>


    <p>The coordinating institution will oversee the activities of the NAP process, main-tain a communications and outreach function, and coordinate the collection of information on the NAP activities for monitoring and evaluation purposes. For the reporting to the Convention, it would also be useful to collect information on sup-port needed and support received. The monitoring and evaluation system should be established during early stages of the process to guide data collection for the reporting and to facilitate learning-by-doing.</p>


    <div class="tGuide_sandyBox"><p class="tGuide_sandyBox_inner">In many cases, the agency that is responsible for climate change activities would be designated to spearhead the NAP process. This should be commu-nicated early and widely, to facilitate coordination of subsequent adaptation planning activities.</p></div>

    <h6 class="upper">A.1.c	Create or enhance a national vision and mandate for the NAP process</h6>

    <p>In order to initiate the mandate and institutional arrangements for the NAP pro-cess, the coordinating mechanism (see A.1.B) would present a recommendation on the creation and structure of the NAP process to a national policymaking body (such as the cabinet, senate or parliament). A proposal on the overall vision for the NAP would be included in this recommendation. Some countries may initiate their NAP process through an act of parliament, a national directive, an executive order

        signed by the President, a national policy or another appropriate instrument, based on the regular procedure for national planning of the country. Such an instrument does not need to represent the overall starting point for the NAP process. In some cases, the process of creating a national mandate would take a long time, in which case other activities may already be initiated to lay the groundwork for the formula-tion of the NAP.</p>

    <div class="tGuide_sandyBox"><p class="tGuide_sandyBox_inner">Many countries that have embarked on a NAP-like process have found it use-ful to create or strive for a formal and binding national instrument in the form of a decree (e.g. Norway), an Act (e.g. the United Kingdom) or an executive order (e.g. the United States of America). Several LDCs have enacted national climate change policies to facilitate their work on aspects of climate change including adaptation, and in cases where this is equivalent to a national policy that could drive the NAP process, they could be a starting point, without re-quiring the creation of a new mandate or policy.</p></div>
